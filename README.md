# Malicious Virtual Meeting Application

Unity project for a Malicious VR meeting application. This environment mimics a teleconferencing app similar to Meta Horizon Workrooms but comes with malicious scripts targeting the visuals and interactions within the environment. 

Inside the project, there's an intelligent agent whose task is to detect and mitigate malicious attacks using the [Unity ML-Agent toolkit](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents).

The goal of this project is to create a testbed for research related to the security of Virtual Reality Applications' output.
