## How to get assets
To personalize the project, you have to buy the following two assets from [CGTrader](https://www.cgtrader.com/): 
   1. [Metaverse Workroom Low-poly 3D model](https://www.cgtrader.com/3d-models/architectural/other/metaverse-workroom)
   2. [Nine VR male characters avatar Low-poly 3D model](https://www.cgtrader.com/3d-models/character/man/nine-vr-male-characters-avatar) 

Nevertheless, if you want to use the project for research/academic purposes, please [contact us](#contact-us).

For the purpose of our paper, we have changed the prefabs of the Metaverse Workroom asset. To have the same prefabs, please go to [How to re-order the prefabs](https://github.com/AmineAndam04/Malicious-VR-Meeting-Env/blob/main/Reorder-Prefabs-MetaWorkroom.md).
